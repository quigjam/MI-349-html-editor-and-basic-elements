            <h3>Intent</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Jesus and I am applying for the position of cashier at Family Music and Records. I have worked for the past of 2000 years for my father's buisness and am hoping to work in a smaller, more intimate 
space. During my time as a motivational speaker I learned many interpersonal skills that can be helpful in customer service. I enjoy interacting with new people and know how to handle conflict gracefully. I have been a huge music fan since the Reneciance and will be able to give quality recommendations to customers. 
            </p>
